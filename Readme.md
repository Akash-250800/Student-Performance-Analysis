Introduction
The Student Performance Analysis project leverages machine learning to predict the academic performance of students based on various features such as study habits, demographics, family background, and more. The objective is to help educators and institutions better understand and support their students.

Features
Machine Learning Models: Various algorithms are used to predict student performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Models are optimized using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for best accuracy.
CI/CD Pipelines: Ensures automated testing, training, and deployment of models using continuous integration and continuous delivery tools.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizations.
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Docker, and Jenkins (optional).
Modeling Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalization.
Model Selection:

Use various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score are used to evaluate model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize model performance by adjusting parameters like learning rates, maximum depth, number of estimators, etc.

Methods used:

GridSearchCV: Performs exhaustive search over a range of hyperparameters.
RandomizedSearchCV: Random search over a grid of hyperparameters to find the best combination.
CI/CD Pipelines
The project uses a CI/CD pipeline for automating testing, training, and deployment. The key components include:

GitHub Actions: For automated testing and deployment.
Docker: To containerize the application for deployment.
Jenkins (Optional): Used to trigger pipeline execution on new commits or pull requests.
Pipeline Workflow:
Code Linting and Testing: Ensure code quality.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train models and check performance.
Dockerization: Build Docker image for the final application.
Deployment: Automatically deploy to cloud or server.
